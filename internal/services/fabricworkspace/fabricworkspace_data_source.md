# azuresql_fabricworkspace (Data Source)

Defines a connection to a fabrick workspace. Creating the data source does not yet open/test the connection. Opening the connection happens when it is used for reading/provisioning other `azuresql` resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "azuresql_fabricworkspace" "workspace" {
  workspace = "myfabricworkspace"
  port   = 1433
}
```

## Schema

### Argument reference
The following arguments are supported:

- `name` (Required, String) Name of the Fabric workspace. This is the value in the url preceeding `.datawarehouse.pbidedicated.windows.net`
  
### Attributes Reference
In addition to the arguments listed above, the following read only attributes are exported:

- `id` (String) ID of the workspace connection in `azuresql`. This ID is passed to other `azuresql` resources and data sources to indicate that the resource should be created in/read from this workspace, respectively.

## ID structure

The ID is formed as `fabric::<name>`, where
* `<name>` is the name of the workspace.
